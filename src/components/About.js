          <p className='property-text-1'>Balgonie Retreat has undergone recent extensive refurbishment having served as a family home for the owners for over 20 years.
Situated in the Borders countryside, this large property uniquely caters for those who love the outdoors and those who simply want to relax in a peaceful setting with woodland, farmland and hillsides all around. The local village West Linton is only a mile down the road and Edinburgh is easily accessible for culture, shopping and memorable nights out in its famous bars and restaurants.</p>

The property itself is ideal for all ages, whether needing to recharge from a day on the hills or simply to put your feet up in front of a warm woodburning fire.
If the weather keeps you indoors there is ample entertainment with a piano, small pool table, table tennis, games, books, TV and a Games TV to keep the younger guests amused.
Outdoors, the large garden is caringly tended and short walks to the nearby river are ideal for clearing the mind and enjoying the local wildlife.
